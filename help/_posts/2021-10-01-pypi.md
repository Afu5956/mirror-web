# PyPI mirror guide

### PyPI synchronises every hour.

### Don't use the `search` feature.
> ERROR: XMLRPC request failed [code: -32500] \
	RuntimeError: PyPI's XMLRPC API is currently disabled due to unmanageable load and will be 
	deprecated in the near future. See [https://status.python.org/](https://status.python.org) for more information.

Note that `simple` cannot be less. It is `HTTPS` instead of `HTTP`.

### Set as defaults

Configure pip after upgrading to the latest version (>=10.0.0):

```
pip install pip -U
pip config set global.index-url https://{{ site.pypi }}/simple
```

Temporarily use this mirror site to upgrade pip:

```
pip install -i https://{{ site.pypi }}/simple pip -U
```
> _If the upgrade of pip fails, for example, the current version of your pip is 9, it is recommended to upgrade
> to 10 first, and then continue to upgrade to the latest version._

### Temporarily use

```
pip install -i https://{{ site.pypi }}/simple some-package
```
